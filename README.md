ImmutableInherit
================

This package provides a single class, ImmutableInherit, that can be used 
in Immutable collections, but be extended through inheritance. Specifically,
it implements Immutable behavior for *is*, *toJS()*, 

It takes a single argument that can be:

* An Immutable class (e.g. Map, List, OrderedMap, ...)
* A JavaScript object
* A JavaScript list

Will finish this later.
